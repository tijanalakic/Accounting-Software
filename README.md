# Accounting-Software
The user of the system is an accountant. Clients whose data are stored in the database can only be sole proprietors (s.p.) registered in the VAT system.
Based on the data from the book of incoming and outgoing invoices, a monthly VAT return is formed. Financial card, ie. the balance between the sole proprietor 
and the client is monitored on the basis of the book of incoming and outgoing invoices and payments and disbursements
Designed a conceptual database model for a system using Erwin Data Modeler. Generated a DDL script, and then
a database schema. Created desktop application in Java programming language. Business logic is implemented in
the database using views, triggers, and stored procedures.
